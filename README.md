# ZMK Config for the Piano 2

The Piano 2 is a keyboard designed by Ben Vallack (@benvallack),
it is a super minimum keyboard with only 18 keys.

I ordered the PCBs from [Ben's PCBWay shared project](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/18_Key_Keyboard_The_Piano_2_afbac38f.html).

## Keyboard Shield

Since we are not using a stock keyboard shield, we need to create our
own one, luckily the [guide](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/new-shield) is well documented by ZMK.

## Keyboard Layout

This tiny little board has more than 10 layers, and has a HID emulated mouse.
